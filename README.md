## Overview

We all have to start somewhere... 
This is a basic website with an image and some text. 
Let's see what I did to make it happen.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- VSStudio Copilot


### What I learned

Even though I have gone through some courses and know a little bit of everything, just figuring out where to start is sometimes very difficult. 
It was a good project to get going. I knew already that design is not my strong suite, I never really understood when to use flexbox and when to use grid. 
I also found that it is quite useful to ask the copilot for tips when I don't remeber how to do stuff, like the rounding of the corners, the shadow effect... 

### Continued development

I am not really sure how I would go about making the design is ready for different size screens other than using flexbox. 
Is it necesarry to use media queries in this case? 


### Useful resources

I mostly used the copilot when I was stuck. Highly recommend.
